    - Sites
    - -all
    - – - -files
    - – - – - -private
    - – - – - – - -newspilot
    - -default
    - – - -files
    - – - – - -private
    - – - – - – - -newspilot

I needed to keep files in the newspilot folder but the files folder and its subfolders 
was ignored like this in the .gitignore: sites/*/files
I also didn’t want the files that exists in files and private. And this was the solution:


    sites/*/files/*
    !sites/*/files/private
    sites/*/files/private/*
    !sites/*/files/private/newspilot

The first line ignores all files and folders in files.
The second line excludes the private folder.
The third line ignores all files and folder in private.
And finally the last line excludes the newspilot folder.
