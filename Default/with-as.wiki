## with/as context managers

- 基本用法

'with expression [as variable]':
    with-block
    
这里expression默认返回一个支持"context management protocol"的对象，
这个对象可能返回一个值被赋予variable变量

- Multiple Context managers in 3.1, 2.7 and later

        with open('data') as fin, open('res', 'w') as fout:
	    for line in fin:
	        if 'some key' in line:
		    fout.write(line)
		    
	with open('data') as fin:
	    with open('res', 'w') as fout:
	        for line in fin:
	            if 'some key' in line:
		        fout.write(line)
