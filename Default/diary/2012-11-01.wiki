how to revert a 'git rm -r .'?


    $git reset HEAD # should do it, if you don't have any uncommited changes.
    $git reset --hard HEAD # should forcibly reset everything to your last commit.
    $git stash             # if you do have uncommited changes and first command
                           # don't work, then save your uncommited changes with it.
    $git reset --hard HEAD
    $git stash pop?
