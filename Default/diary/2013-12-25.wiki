## How to remove git submodule

see: http://davidwalsh.name/git-remove-submodule

- Delete the relevant section from the .gitmodules file.  The section would look similar to:

    [submodule "vendor"]
    path = vendor
    url = git://github.com/some-user/some-repo.git
    
- Stage the .gitmodules changes via command line using:git add .gitmodules
- Delete the relevant section from .git/config, which will look like:
    [submodule "vendor"]
    url = git://github.com/some-user/some-repo.git
    
- Run git rm --cached path/to/submodule .  
Don't include a trailing slash -- that will lead to an error.
- Run rm -rf .git/modules/submodule_name
- Commit the change:
- Delete the now untracked submodule files rm -rf path/to/submodule

Skips are dangerous — you need to remember to remove them before you 
commit your changes back to the repo. This is why line-by-line reviews 
of each of your diffs are a good idea!
