# while an for Loops

## while Loops

### General Format
while format:

    while <test>:
        <statement1>
    else:
        <statement2>

### break, continue, pass and the Loop else

*break*:jump out of the closest enclosing test
*continue*: jump to the top of the loop, ignore all the rest statement inside.
*pass*: placeholder,
*Loop else block*: run only if the loop exited normally(without hitting a break.)

## for Loops

### General Format

    for <target> in <object>:
        <statements>
    else:
        <statements> 
        


## Loop Coding Techniques
for loop is simpler to code and quicker than while to run.

*Difference between 'for' and 'while'*:
for iterate through the item in a sequence?
while is just a repeation
*Difference between 'break' and 'continue'*:
break get out of the loop imediatelly, continue just get out of the loop one time.

*generator object*: a kind of object that supports the iteration protocol.
