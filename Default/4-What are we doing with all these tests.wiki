Programming is like pulling a bucket of water up from a well.

When the well isn't too deep, and the bucket isn't very full,
it's easy. And even lifting a full bucket is pretty easy at first.
But after a while, you're get tired, TDD is like having a ratchet that
let you save your progress, take a break, and make sure you never slip
backwards.                   Kent Beck(who basically invented TDD)


The more atomic your commits, the better.

Refactor -- improve the code without changing the functionality.

When refactoring, working on either the code or the tests, but not
both at once.

重构的时候，要么修改代码要么修改测试，但不要同时进行两项。
